# Portfolio Project Showcase

Welcome to my Portfolio Project! This project serves as a demonstration of my skills and expertise in web development, showcasing a variety of technologies and techniques to create a robust and visually appealing application.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** Provides server-side rendering and efficient routing for a seamless user experience.
- **TypeScript:** Enhances development with static typing and improved code maintainability.
- **Prisma:** Acts as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for streamlined database interactions.
- **Swiper.js:** Integrates carousels and sliders for dynamic content presentation.
- **Framer Motion:** Injects life into the application with smooth animations and transitions.
- **Next UI:** Offers pre-built UI components and a foundation for consistent styling.
- **Scroll Trigger:** Enables animations to react to user scrolling behavior, creating an interactive experience.
- **Next Auth:** Simplifies user authentication and authorization processes.
- **bcrypt:** Ensures secure password storage by implementing hashing.
- **Zod:** Validates user input and defines data schemas for robust data management.
- **SWR:** Optimizes data fetching and caching for improved performance.
- **Moment.js:** Provides tools for parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times with ease.
- **MongoDB:** Serves as the data storage solution for the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project_directory]`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Configure environment variables (if necessary).
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
6. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Project Structure

- **pages/:** Houses Next.js page components that define the application's structure.
- **components/:** Includes reusable UI components for building consistent and modular interfaces.
- **styles/:** Contains global styles and theme configurations for a unified visual identity.
- **public/:** Stores static assets like images and fonts that are directly accessible by the browser.
- **utils/:** Encompasses utility functions and helper modules for common tasks.
- **api/:** Hosts server-side endpoints or API routes for interacting with the backend and data.
- **lib/:** Contains application-wide utility functions and modules for code organization.

## Deployment
#Deploymen is here [adswift.me](https://adswift.me).
Effortlessly deploy your project on Vercel by following these steps:

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
2. Install Vercel CLI globally: `npm install -g vercel`
3. Log in using your Vercel account credentials: `vercel login`
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
5. Deploy the project: `vercel`

Vercel will provide a unique URL where your application is live!
